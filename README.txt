A wordpress plugin for retrieving images and values through the Panoramio API.

== Description ==

A wordpress widget that retrieve images from Panoramio API.

HOW TO
To display the widget, add a custom field to a post called "panoramio". The value of panoramio should be the coordinate to the area that you want to display pictures from.
The value should be formatted like this: X:Y

It is also possible to supply the script with two coordinates, for a more precise area. Use this format: minx:miny:maxx:maxy  

All coordinates should be given in the decimal form of latitude/longitude. I recommend using http://mapki.com/getLonLat.php.

CHANGELOG

-Added AJAX support
